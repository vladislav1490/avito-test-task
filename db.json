She was given at the station four green receipts saying the sofa, suitcase, carpetbag, painting, basket, cardboard box, and the little dog were received. The items were loaded on the platform and tossed into the open wagon. It's done. The baggage is packed: sofa, suitcase, carpetbag, painting, basket, cardboard box, and the little dog. But just as the bell rang, the puppy ran away from the wagon. They missed a place in the baggage count: sofa, suitcase, carpetbag, painting, basket, cardboard box...—Comrades! Where's the little dog? Suddenly, they see a large scruffy dog standing by the wheels. They caught it—and into the baggage it went, where the carpetbag, painting, basket, and cardboard box were, where once the little dog had been. They arrived in the city of Zhytomyr. The porter with the fifteenth number was carrying the baggage: sofa, suitcase, carpetbag, painting, basket, and cardboard box, and behind them led the dog. The dog barked, and the lady shouted: 'Thieves! Bandits! Scoundrels! The dog is not the right breed!' She threw down the suitcase, kicked away the sofa, the painting, the basket, the cardboard box…— 'Give me back my little dog!'— 'Excuse me, madam! At the station, according to the receipt, you were given a sofa, suitcase, carpetbag, painting, basket, cardboard box, and a little dog. However, during the journey, the dog could have grown!'",
